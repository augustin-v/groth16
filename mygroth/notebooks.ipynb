    "Thanks to RareSkill's awesome ZK book I've acquired enough knowledge to implement Groth16 in python.<br>Though I don't expect this to be easy, I'll leverage my giga brain and exceptional resilience to apply what I've learned to this complex and interesting project.\n",

    "### Quick introduction to Groth16\n",
    "Groth16 is a magic algorithm to validate that a statement is true without revealing any information about the inputs.<br>\n",
    "For example, imagine that you want to prove to someone that you know a secret number that satisfies a specific equation without revealing the number itself; <br>the Groth16 algorithm could do just that.\n",
    "It is known for its efficiency and small proof size, though it comes with one compromise: The need of a trusted setup.\n",

    "### Polynomial Secret Proof PoC \n",
    "To dive into the practical implementation of Groth16, I'll start with a foundational example that showcases its core strengths.<br> \n",
    "I'm going to implement a system that proves knowledge of a secret value that satisfies a polynomial equation:<br> something like proving **I know a secret {x,y,z} such that $5x² + xy + 4z³ = 1059$**, without ever revealing what s actually is. <BR><BR> The prover (likely the user) must provide the correct ${x,y,x}$ values which in our case are: $x = 13$,  $y = 14$,  $z = 2$ though they will stay private and the verifier will not have access to these raw values.\n",
